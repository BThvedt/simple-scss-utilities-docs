(ok that's an obvious step)\r\n- Read the [Install](/install/) page\r\n- Have a design in mind! A professional document, a napkin sketch, or just a mental image. Pick out your colors (I like to use [coolers.co](/https://coolors.co/)) and your fonts (I just use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)) and change them to what you want!\r\n- As you start development, edit whatever other class values to whatever your design needs. Like with Tailwind, it's probably useful to have the docs open in a seperate window until you're used to the class names. If you'rue comfortable with the source scss files, you can also search in those with `ctrl-f`. Glance through the [Customize](/customize/) section for more examples!\r\n- This framework isn't made to handle everything. It's written to be useful, and get out of the way, with those that like writing their own styles in ind. A rule of thumb is: if it's a basic or boring widely-used CSS property, it's probably in the framework. If it's not, it's probably not!\r\n- For the rest of your styles, do whatever you want! I like to use SCSS modules for components, plus a general SCSS stylesheet. But the utiltiy classes do a lot. For this site -outside of the front page banner- I use only 4 lines of SCSS in a single module.\r\n\r\nHappy coding!\r\n","frontmatter":{"description":"How to use the Fonts","title":"Getting Started","type":"docs","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"eb723e8c-6585-5a75-b0e5-7a01f8b3d3a4","frontmatter__type":"docs","frontmatter__slug":"colors-and-fonts","__params":{"frontmatter__type":"docs","frontmatter__slug":"colors-and-fonts"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started","tags":["grid"],"type":"docs","category":"grid","description":"How to use the Fonts","isCategoryRoot":true,"slug":"colors-and-fonts","order":5}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2241216091"],"slicesMap":{}}
