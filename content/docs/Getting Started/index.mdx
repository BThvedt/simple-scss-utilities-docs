# Getting Started

#### Advice and Direction on How to Dive In

Ok so here's some direction on how to get started!

- First, start a new project! (ok that's an obvious step)
- Read the [Install](/install/) page
- Have a design in mind! A professional document, a napkin sketch, or just a mental image. Pick out your colors (I like to use [coolers.co](/https://coolors.co/)) and your fonts (I just use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)) and change them to what you want!
- As you start development, edit whatever other class values to whatever your design needs. Like with Tailwind, it's probably useful to have the docs open in a seperate window until you're used to the class names. If you'rue comfortable with the source scss files, you can also search in those with `ctrl-f`. Glance through the [Customize](/customize/) section for more examples!
- This framework isn't made to handle everything. It's written to be useful, and get out of the way, with those that like writing their own styles in ind. A rule of thumb is: if it's a basic or boring widely-used CSS property, it's probably in the framework. If it's not, it's probably not!
- For the rest of your styles, do whatever you want! I like to use SCSS modules for components, plus a general SCSS stylesheet. But the utiltiy classes do a lot. For this site -outside of the front page banner- I use only 4 lines of SCSS in a single module.

Happy coding!
