# Important! Purge!

#### Purging will give a nice, light CSS files

Like any Utiltiy class framework, the CSS files generate are large. The default generated file is over 600 KB. For comparison, the entire game of Super Mario 3 was 40 Kb - less than 1/10th the size! It's amazing what being efficient with data can do, isn't it?

<div className="center mb-xl pt-md">

<figure className="w-20">
  <img src={MarioImage} alt="Logo" />
  <figcaption className="text-sm">
    <Paragraph
      className="text-md py-md"
      text="The entire game of SMB 3 was 40 KB - smaller than this image! (66 KB) (Yeah I could have compressed it but I'm just sayin')"
    />
  </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

Anyway. This page is just here to remind more than anythng:

### It's Important to Purge!

The Install instructions have everythng you need to know about purging. Save 100's of KB's of page load. Even in today's world of speedy internet it can still make a difference. I just wanted to stress the point!

Happy purging, and happy coding!
