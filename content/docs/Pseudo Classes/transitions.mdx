# Transitions

#### Make it smooth

A natural followup to colors and pseudo classes is transitions.

By default, the transition classes have the form `transition-[speed]` for all `transition-[type]-[speed]` for the other properties and the css is as follows:

Applying transition: all whenever a transition is needed can lead to unwanted janky side effects sometimes, so more specific classes targeting widely used properties are useful. I think these classes should cover the majority of use cases, and although the framework doesn't come with any transform classes, it might be helpful to still have transition classes that apply to transform.

Transitions by default come in 5 flavors:

- All
- Colors
- Opacity
- Box Shadow
- and Transform

In addition to these classes, transitions also come in various speeds:

- 1s (one second)
- slow (700 ms)
- med (500 ms)
- default (300 ms)
- and Fast (150 ms, my favorite)

for a total of 25 different default classes.

The transition function is always `ease-in-out` although this can be customized in the `_variables.scss` file as well as the names and times:

<CodeWrapper title="_variables.scss" isFile>

```scss
$transition-function: ease-in-out; // change the function here
// both the keys and values can be changed in this map as well:
$transition-speeds: (
  "1s": 1s,
  "slow": 700ms,
  "med": 500ms,
  "default": 300ms,
  "fast": 150ms
);
```

</CodeWrapper>

## Using Transitions with Pseudo Classes

Transitions can make your pseudo classes nice and smooth. Let's take a look at a button with a bunch of `:hover` and `:active` classes as an exmaple. I use a `transition-colors-default` class to animate it smoothly, notice how all the various color properties transition when you hover and/or press the button:

<div className="flex center pt-lg pb-2xl">
  <button className="px-lg py-sm bg-green-ltr text-blue-dkr font-large text-xl center cursor-pointer radius-lg hover:bg-blue hover:text-white active:text-black active:bg-magenta transition-colors-default border-md border-green-dk hover:border-white active:border-black">
    <Paragraph className="s" text="Click Me, I'm a Button" />
  </button>
</div>

Here is the Html (I broke the color classes into seperate lines for readability):

<CodeWrapper title="Html" >

```html
<button
  class="px-lg py-sm font-large text-xl radius-lg cursor-pointer border-md

      bg-green-ltr 
      text-blue-dkr 
      border-green-dk

      hover:bg-blue 
      hover:text-white 
      hover:border-white

      active:text-black 
      active:bg-magenta 
      active:border-black
			
      transition-colors-default"
>
  Click Me, I'm a Button
</button>
```

</CodeWrapper>

Hopefully this provides a good overview of how to use the transition classes!
